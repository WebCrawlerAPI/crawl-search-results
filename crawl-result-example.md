### "Highly recommend Octoparse as scraping tool for individuals and teams"

Octoparse is very efficient and can handle very complex web scraping issues. I think it was made with high-end data scraping solutions in mind. It handles screen scraping, sites with Javascript, Ajax, scrolling, items within Iframe, etc., and 'get' requests API scraping. I have been using it since 2019, and it is highly recommended.

### "Great tool for scraping and huge time-saver"

What I appreciate most is how flexible and adaptable Octoparse is. I’m a creative producer, and the kinds of info I need to collect change constantly - sometimes it’s contact lists, sometimes niche content references, and sometimes market research across totally different industries. Octoparse handles all of it surprisingly well Before this I honestly avoided web scraping because I couldn’t find a solution that didn’t require technical skills or coding. But Octoparse made it feel doable. The interface is clear, and most things can be set up visually without any background in programming. I don’t use it on a daily basis, but I’m increasingly finding use cases where Octoparse can be really helpful in my work I also love that I can export everything directly into Google Sheets, it fits into the way I already organize my research. Cloud mode is another huge bonus - I can run tasks in the background while working on other things without worrying about leaving my computer on all night Overall, it’s taken a lot of chaotic manual work and turned it into something structured and repeatable. Also great respect for the Support Team, which is extremely fast and super helpful

### "Octoparse is our AI in Web Scraper"

Octoparse is an indispensable tool for any type of analysis, specific searches, and data extraction. It is truly exceptional; the web scraping they perform is perfect, practical, and vital for data extraction, as it facilitates our online sales activity. In other words, without Octoparse, we wouldn't have such detailed and specific information. Now with their templates, we can compete equally with large companies and logistics platforms in terms of price and information. We have been working with them for a couple of years, and they keep getting better, meaning they are constantly updating their tool/web program Octoparse 8, achieving greater stability in information extraction. We also highlight their great technical team, who are always advising on the best work options. In short, for us, there is a before and after with Octoparse. Highly recommended for making our daily work easier.

### "Octoparse would do the scraping for you!"

What I like about the octoparse is they use the AI for automating the scraping process. For example, if you want to retrieve the food review from a map application, it will try to retrieve the important parts like title, description, coordinates, and many more without human intervention. Octoparse will do it for you from the start to the end of the process. If the tool got problems for retrieving the element, you could retrieve them And even, they have templates that you can use, so you don't need to click which elements you want to retrieve. Let Octoparse do the process.

In September 1826, **[Margaret Warden died](/wiki/Poisoning_of_Margaret_Warden "Poisoning of Margaret Warden")** by [arsenic poisoning](/wiki/Arsenic_poisoning "Arsenic poisoning"), near [Dundee](/wiki/Dundee "Dundee"), Scotland. Warden, a young servant girl, was pregnant at the time of her death; the father was George Smith, the son of Warden's employers, Mary and David Smith. The attending doctor thought Warden died of [cholera](/wiki/Cholera "Cholera"), but rumours of poisoning soon spread and she was exhumed. Her stomach contents were tested; [arsenic](/wiki/Arsenic "Arsenic") was found, and in October Mary Smith was committed for trial for murder. Her defence advocates called nearly fifty witnesses, and the trial began on 19 February. Testimony at the trial made it clear that Smith had given Warden something to drink shortly before she became ill. The defence called witnesses who testified that Warden might have committed suicide. The jury returned a verdict of [not proven](/wiki/Not_proven "Not proven"), acquitting Smith of the crime. Popular opinion at the time was that Smith was guilty, and ballads were written about the case. One of Smith's lawyers later wrote that he was sure she had committed the murder. _(**[Full article...](/wiki/Poisoning_of_Margaret_Warden "Poisoning of Margaret Warden")**)_

Today's featured picture

------------------------

[](/wiki/File:Babosas_de_mar_\(Chromodoris_strigata\),_Anilao,_Filipinas,_2023-08-22,_DD_172.jpg "Chromodoris annae")

_**[Chromodoris annae](/wiki/Chromodoris_annae "Chromodoris annae")**_ is a species of [sea slug](/wiki/Sea_slug "Sea slug") in the family [Chromodorididae](/wiki/Chromodorididae "Chromodorididae"). It is found in the tropical central area of the Indo-Pacific region from Malaysia, Indonesia and the Philippines to the Marshall Islands, a region rich in biodiversity and rich in [coral](/wiki/Coral "Coral"), [mangroves](/wiki/Mangrove "Mangrove") and [seagrasses](/wiki/Seagrass "Seagrass"). _C. annae_ has an elongated body, reaching a maximum length of 5 centimetres (2.0 in), and is coloured in various shades of blue with black spots, its mantle edge and foot being bordered with white and orange-to-yellow lines. The sea slug's diet consists solely of _Petrosaspongia_, part of the [Thorectidae](/wiki/Thorectidae "Thorectidae") family of sea sponges. It absorbs a noxious chemical from the sponge, storing it in its glands and using it to deter predation. _C. annae_ is generally a docile species, but individuals have been occasionally sighted fighting each other. These _C. annae_ sea slugs were photographed in the diving resort of Anilao in [Mabini, Batangas](/wiki/Mabini,_Batangas "Mabini, Batangas"), in the Philippines.

**Web scraping**, **web harvesting**, or **web data extraction** is [data scraping](/wiki/Data_scraping "Data scraping") used for [extracting data](/wiki/Data_extraction "Data extraction") from [websites](/wiki/Website "Website").[\[1\]](#cite_note-1) Web scraping software may directly access the [World Wide Web](/wiki/World_Wide_Web "World Wide Web") using the [Hypertext Transfer Protocol](/wiki/Hypertext_Transfer_Protocol "Hypertext Transfer Protocol") or a web browser. While web scraping can be done manually by a software user, the term typically refers to automated processes implemented using a [bot](/wiki/Internet_bot "Internet bot") or [web crawler](/wiki/Web_crawler "Web crawler"). It is a form of copying in which specific data is gathered and copied from the web, typically into a central local [database](/wiki/Database "Database") or [spreadsheet](/wiki/Spreadsheet "Spreadsheet"), for later [retrieval](/wiki/Data_retrieval "Data retrieval") or [analysis](/wiki/Data_analysis "Data analysis").

Scraping a web page involves fetching it and then extracting data from it. Fetching is the downloading of a page (which a browser does when a user views a page). Therefore, web crawling is a main component of web scraping, to fetch pages for later processing. Having fetched, extraction can take place. The content of a page may be [parsed](/wiki/Parsing "Parsing"), searched and reformatted, and its data copied into a spreadsheet or loaded into a database. Web scrapers typically take something out of a page, to make use of it for another purpose somewhere else. An example would be finding and copying names and telephone numbers, companies and their URLs, or e-mail addresses to a list (contact scraping).

As well as [contact scraping](/wiki/Contact_scraping "Contact scraping"), web scraping is used as a component of applications used for [web indexing](/wiki/Web_indexing "Web indexing"), [web mining](/wiki/Web_mining "Web mining") and [data mining](/wiki/Data_mining "Data mining"), online price change monitoring and [price comparison](/wiki/Comparison_shopping_website "Comparison shopping website"), product review scraping (to watch the competition), gathering real estate listings, weather data monitoring, [website change detection](/wiki/Change_detection_and_notification "Change detection and notification"), research, tracking online presence and reputation, [web mashup](/wiki/Web_mashup "Web mashup"), and [web data integration](/wiki/Web_data_integration "Web data integration").

[Web pages](/wiki/Web_page "Web page") are built using text-based mark-up languages ([HTML](/wiki/HTML "HTML") and [XHTML](/wiki/XHTML "XHTML")), and frequently contain a wealth of useful data in text form. However, most web pages are designed for human [end-users](/wiki/End-user_\(computer_science\) "End-user (computer science)") and not for ease of automated use. As a result, specialized tools and software have been developed to facilitate the scraping of web pages. Web scraping applications include [market research](/wiki/Market_research "Market research"), price comparison, content monitoring and [artificial intelligence](/wiki/Artificial_intelligence "Artificial intelligence"). Businesses rely on web scraping services to efficiently gather and utilize this data.

Newer forms of web scraping involve monitoring [data feeds](/wiki/Data_feed "Data feed") from web servers. For example, [JSON](/wiki/JSON "JSON") is commonly used as a transport mechanism between the client and the web server.

There are methods that some websites use to prevent web scraping, such as detecting and disallowing bots from crawling (viewing) their pages. In response, web scraping systems use techniques involving [DOM](/wiki/Document_Object_Model "Document Object Model") parsing, [computer vision](/wiki/Computer_vision "Computer vision") and [natural language processing](/wiki/Natural_language_processing "Natural language processing") to simulate human browsing to enable gathering web page content for offline parsing.

History

-------

\[[edit](/w/index.php?title=Web_scraping&action=edit&section=1 "Edit section: History")\]

After the [birth of the World Wide Web](/wiki/History_of_the_World_Wide_Web "History of the World Wide Web") in 1989, the first web robot,[\[2\]](#cite_note-2) [World Wide Web Wanderer](/wiki/World_Wide_Web_Wanderer "World Wide Web Wanderer"), was created in June 1993, which was intended only to measure the size of the web.

In December 1993, the first crawler-based web search engine, [JumpStation](/wiki/JumpStation "JumpStation"), was launched. As there were fewer websites available on the web, search engines at that time used to rely on human administrators to collect and format links. In comparison, Jump Station was the first WWW search engine to rely on a web robot.

In 2000, the first Web API and API crawler were created. An [API](/wiki/Application_programming_interface "Application programming interface") (Application Programming Interface) is an interface that makes it much easier to develop a program by providing the building blocks. In 2000, [Salesforce](/wiki/Salesforce.com "Salesforce.com") and [eBay](/wiki/EBay "EBay") launched their own API, with which programmers could access and download some of the data available to the public.[\[3\]](#cite_note-3) Since then, many websites offer web APIs for people to access their public database.

Techniques

----------

\[[edit](/w/index.php?title=Web_scraping&action=edit&section=2 "Edit section: Techniques")\]

This section **contains [instructions or advice](/wiki/Wikipedia:What_Wikipedia_is_not#GUIDE "Wikipedia:What Wikipedia is not")**. Wikipedia is not a guidebook; please help [rewrite such content](https://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Web_scraping&action=edit) to be encyclopedic or move it to [Wikiversity](https://en.wikiversity.org/wiki/ "v:"), [Wikibooks](https://en.wikibooks.org/wiki/ "b:"), or [Wikivoyage](https://en.wikivoyage.org/wiki/ "voy:"). _(October 2025)_

Web scraping is the process of automatically mining data or collecting information from the World Wide Web. It is a field with active developments sharing a common goal with the [semantic web](/wiki/Semantic_web "Semantic web") vision, an ambitious initiative that still requires breakthroughs in text processing, semantic understanding, artificial intelligence and [human-computer interactions](/wiki/Human-computer_interaction "Human-computer interaction").

### Human copy-and-paste

\[[edit](/w/index.php?title=Web_scraping&action=edit&section=3 "Edit section: Human copy-and-paste")\]

The simplest form of web scraping is manually copying and pasting data from a web page into a text file or spreadsheet. Sometimes even the best web-scraping technology cannot replace a human's manual examination and copy-and-paste, and sometimes this may be the only workable solution when the websites for scraping explicitly set up barriers to prevent machine automation.

### Text pattern matching

\[[edit](/w/index.php?title=Web_scraping&action=edit&section=4 "Edit section: Text pattern matching")\]

A simple yet powerful approach to extract information from web pages can be based on the UNIX [grep](/wiki/Grep "Grep") command or [regular expression](/wiki/Regular_expression "Regular expression")\-matching facilities of programming languages (for instance [Perl](/wiki/Perl "Perl") or [Python](/wiki/Python_\(programming_language\) "Python (programming language)")).

### HTTP programming

\[[edit](/w/index.php?title=Web_scraping&action=edit&section=5 "Edit section: HTTP programming")\]

[Static](/wiki/Static_web_page "Static web page") and [dynamic web pages](/wiki/Dynamic_web_page "Dynamic web page") can be retrieved by posting HTTP requests to the remote web server using [socket programming](/wiki/Socket_programming "Socket programming").

### HTML parsing

\[[edit](/w/index.php?title=Web_scraping&action=edit&section=6 "Edit section: HTML parsing")\]

Many websites have large collections of pages generated dynamically from an underlying structured source like a database. Data of the same category are typically encoded into similar pages by a common script or template. In data mining, a program that detects such templates in a particular information source, extracts its content, and translates it into a relational form, is called a [wrapper](/wiki/Wrapper_\(data_mining\) "Wrapper (data mining)"). Wrapper generation algorithms assume that input pages of a wrapper induction system conform to a common template and that they can be easily identified in terms of a URL common scheme.[\[4\]](#cite_note-4) Moreover, some [semi-structured data](/wiki/Semi-structured_data "Semi-structured data") query languages, such as [XQuery](/wiki/XQuery "XQuery") and the HTQL, can be used to parse HTML pages and to retrieve and transform page content.

### DOM parsing

\[[edit](/w/index.php?title=Web_scraping&action=edit&section=7 "Edit section: DOM parsing")\]

Further information: [Document Object Model](/wiki/Document_Object_Model "Document Object Model")

By using a program such as [Selenium](/wiki/Selenium_\(software\) "Selenium (software)") or [Playwright](/wiki/Playwright_\(software\) "Playwright (software)"), developers can control a web browser such as [Chrome](/wiki/ChromeOS "ChromeOS") or [Firefox](/wiki/Firefox "Firefox") wherein they can load, navigate, and retrieve data from websites. This method can be especially useful for scraping data from dynamic sites since a web browser will fully load each page. Once an entire page is loaded, you can access and parse the [DOM](/wiki/Document_Object_Model "Document Object Model") using an expression language such as [XPath](/wiki/XPath "XPath").

### Vertical aggregation

\[[edit](/w/index.php?title=Web_scraping&action=edit&section=8 "Edit section: Vertical aggregation")\]

There are several companies that have developed vertical specific harvesting platforms. These platforms create and monitor a multitude of "bots" for specific verticals with no "man in the loop" (no direct human involvement), and no work related to a specific target site. The preparation involves establishing the knowledge base for the entire vertical and then the platform creates the bots automatically. The platform's robustness is measured by the quality of the information it retrieves (usually number of fields) and its scalability (how quick it can scale up to hundreds or thousands of sites). This scalability is mostly used to target the [Long Tail](/wiki/Long_Tail "Long Tail") of sites that common aggregators find complicated or too labor-intensive to harvest content from.

### Semantic annotation recognizing

\[[edit](/w/index.php?title=Web_scraping&action=edit&section=9 "Edit section: Semantic annotation recognizing")\]

The pages being scraped may embrace [metadata](/wiki/Metadata "Metadata") or semantic markups and annotations, which can be used to locate specific data snippets. If the annotations are embedded in the pages, as [Microformat](/wiki/Microformat "Microformat") does, this technique can be viewed as a special case of DOM parsing. In another case, the annotations, organized into a semantic layer,[\[5\]](#cite_note-5) are stored and managed separately from the web pages, so the scrapers can retrieve data schema and instructions from this layer before scraping the pages.

### Computer vision web-page analysis

\[[edit](/w/index.php?title=Web_scraping&action=edit&section=10 "Edit section: Computer vision web-page analysis")\]

There are efforts using [machine learning](/wiki/Machine_learning "Machine learning") and [computer vision](/wiki/Computer_vision "Computer vision") that attempt to identify and extract information from web pages by interpreting pages visually as a human being might.[\[6\]](#cite_note-6)

### AI-powered document understanding

\[[edit](/w/index.php?title=Web_scraping&action=edit&section=11 "Edit section: AI-powered document understanding")\]

Uses advanced AI to interpret and process web page content contextually, extracting relevant information, transforming data, and customizing outputs based on the content's structure and meaning. This method enables more intelligent and flexible data extraction, accommodating complex and dynamic web content[\[7\]](#cite_note-7).

Legal issues

------------

\[[edit](/w/index.php?title=Web_scraping&action=edit&section=12 "Edit section: Legal issues")\]

The examples and perspective in this section **deal primarily with the United States and do not represent a [worldwide view](/wiki/Wikipedia:WikiProject_Countering_systemic_bias "Wikipedia:WikiProject Countering systemic bias") of the subject**. You may [improve this section](https://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Web_scraping&action=edit), discuss the issue on the [talk page](/wiki/Talk:Web_scraping "Talk:Web scraping"), or create a new section, as appropriate. _(October 2015)_ _([Learn how and when to remove this message](/wiki/Help:Maintenance_template_removal "Help:Maintenance template removal"))_

The legality of web scraping varies across the world. In general, web scraping may be against the [terms of service](/wiki/Terms_of_service "Terms of service") of some websites, but the enforceability of these terms is unclear.[\[8\]](#cite_note-8)

### United States

\[[edit](/w/index.php?title=Web_scraping&action=edit&section=13 "Edit section: United States")\]

In the United States, website owners can use three major [legal claims](/wiki/Cause_of_action "Cause of action") to prevent undesired web scraping: (1) copyright infringement (compilation), (2) violation of the [Computer Fraud and Abuse Act](/wiki/Computer_Fraud_and_Abuse_Act "Computer Fraud and Abuse Act") ("CFAA"), and (3) [trespass to chattel](/wiki/Trespass_to_chattels "Trespass to chattels").[\[9\]](#cite_note-9) However, the effectiveness of these claims relies upon meeting various criteria, and the case law is still evolving. For example, with regard to copyright, while outright duplication of original expression will in many cases be illegal, in the United States the courts ruled in [_Feist Publications v. Rural Telephone Service_](/wiki/Feist_Publications,_Inc.,_v._Rural_Telephone_Service_Co. "Feist Publications, Inc., v. Rural Telephone Service Co.") that duplication of facts is allowable.

U.S. courts have acknowledged that users of "scrapers" or "robots" may be held liable for committing [trespass to chattels](/wiki/Trespass_to_chattels "Trespass to chattels"),[\[10\]](#cite_note-10)[\[11\]](#cite_note-11) which involves a computer system itself being considered personal property upon which the user of a scraper is trespassing. The best known of these cases, _[eBay v. Bidder's Edge](/wiki/EBay_v._Bidder%27s_Edge "EBay v. Bidder's Edge")_, resulted in an injunction ordering Bidder's Edge to stop accessing, collecting, and indexing auctions from the eBay web site. This case involved automatic placing of bids, known as [auction sniping](/wiki/Auction_sniping "Auction sniping"). However, in order to succeed on a claim of trespass to [chattels](/wiki/Personal_property "Personal property"), the [plaintiff](/wiki/Plaintiff "Plaintiff") must demonstrate that the [defendant](/wiki/Defendant "Defendant") intentionally and without authorization interfered with the plaintiff's possessory interest in the computer system and that the defendant's unauthorized use caused damage to the plaintiff. Not all cases of web spidering brought before the courts have been considered trespass to chattels.[\[12\]](#cite_note-12)

One of the first major tests of [screen scraping](/wiki/Screen_scraping "Screen scraping") involved [American Airlines](/wiki/American_Airlines "American Airlines") (AA), and a firm called FareChase.[\[13\]](#cite_note-13) AA successfully obtained an [injunction](/wiki/Injunction "Injunction") from a Texas trial court, stopping FareChase from selling software that enables users to compare online fares if the software also searches AA's website. The airline argued that FareChase's websearch software trespassed on AA's servers when it collected the publicly available data. FareChase filed an appeal in March 2003. By June, FareChase and AA agreed to settle and the appeal was dropped.[\[14\]](#cite_note-14)

[Southwest Airlines](/wiki/Southwest_Airlines "Southwest Airlines") has also challenged screen-scraping practices, and has involved both FareChase and another firm, Outtask, in a legal claim. Southwest Airlines charged that the screen-scraping is Illegal since it is an example of "Computer Fraud and Abuse" and has led to "Damage and Loss" and "Unauthorized Access" of Southwest's site. It also constitutes "Interference with Business Relations", "Trespass", and "Harmful Access by Computer". They also claimed that screen-scraping constitutes what is legally known as "Misappropriation and Unjust Enrichment", as well as being a breach of the web site's user agreement. Outtask denied all these claims, claiming that the prevailing law, in this case, should be [US Copyright law](/wiki/US_Copyright_law "US Copyright law") and that under copyright, the pieces of information being scraped would not be subject to copyright protection. Although the cases were never resolved in the [Supreme Court of the United States](/wiki/Supreme_Court_of_the_United_States "Supreme Court of the United States"), FareChase was eventually shuttered by parent company [Yahoo!](/wiki/Yahoo! "Yahoo!"), and Outtask was purchased by travel expense company Concur.[\[15\]](#cite_note-impervawp2011-15) In 2012, a startup called 3Taps scraped classified housing ads from Craigslist. Craigslist sent 3Taps a cease-and-desist letter and blocked their IP addresses and later sued, in _[Craigslist v. 3Taps](/wiki/Craigslist_v._3Taps "Craigslist v. 3Taps")_. The court held that the cease-and-desist letter and IP blocking was sufficient for Craigslist to properly claim that 3Taps had violated the [Computer Fraud and Abuse Act](/wiki/Computer_Fraud_and_Abuse_Act "Computer Fraud and Abuse Act") (CFAA).

Although these are early scraping decisions, and the theories of liability are not uniform, it is difficult to ignore a pattern emerging that the courts are prepared to protect proprietary content on commercial sites from uses which are undesirable to the owners of such sites. However, the degree of protection for such content is not settled and will depend on the type of access made by the scraper, the amount of information accessed and copied, the degree to which the access adversely affects the site owner's system and the types and manner of prohibitions on such conduct.[\[16\]](#cite_note-16)

While the law in this area becomes more settled, entities contemplating using scraping programs to access a public web site should also consider whether such action is authorized by reviewing the terms of use and other terms or notices posted on or made available through the site. In _[Cvent Inc.](/wiki/Cvent "Cvent") v. [Eventbrite Inc.](/wiki/Eventbrite "Eventbrite")_ (2010), the United States [district court for the eastern district of Virginia](/wiki/United_States_District_Court_for_the_Eastern_District_of_Virginia "United States District Court for the Eastern District of Virginia"), ruled that the terms of use should be brought to the users' attention in order for a [browsewrap](/wiki/Browsewrap "Browsewrap") contract or license to be enforceable.[\[17\]](#cite_note-17) In a 2014 case, filed in the [United States District Court for the Eastern District of Pennsylvania](/wiki/United_States_District_Court_for_the_Eastern_District_of_Pennsylvania "United States District Court for the Eastern District of Pennsylvania"),[\[18\]](#cite_note-18) e-commerce site [QVC](/wiki/QVC "QVC") objected to the Pinterest-like shopping aggregator Resultly's 'scraping of QVC's site for real-time pricing data. QVC alleges that Resultly "excessively crawled" QVC's retail site (allegedly sending 200-300 search requests to QVC's website per minute, sometimes to up to 36,000 requests per minute) which caused QVC's site to crash for two days, resulting in lost sales for QVC.[\[19\]](#cite_note-19) QVC's complaint alleges that the defendant disguised its web crawler to mask its source IP address and thus prevented QVC from quickly repairing the problem. This is a particularly interesting scraping case because QVC is seeking damages for the unavailability of their website, which QVC claims was caused by Resultly.

In the plaintiff's web site during the period of this trial, the terms of use link are displayed among all the links of the site, at the bottom of the page as most sites on the internet. This ruling contradicts the Irish ruling described below. The court also rejected the plaintiff's argument that the browse-wrap restrictions were enforceable in view of Virginia's adoption of the Uniform Computer Information Transactions Act (UCITA)—a uniform law that many believed was in favor on common browse-wrap contracting practices.[\[20\]](#cite_note-20)

In _[Facebook, Inc. v. Power Ventures, Inc.](/wiki/Facebook,_Inc._v._Power_Ventures,_Inc. "Facebook, Inc. v. Power Ventures, Inc.")_, a district court ruled in 2012 that Power Ventures could not scrape Facebook pages on behalf of a Facebook user. The case is on appeal, and the [Electronic Frontier Foundation](/wiki/Electronic_Frontier_Foundation "Electronic Frontier Foundation") filed a brief in 2015 asking that it be overturned.[\[21\]](#cite_note-21)[\[22\]](#cite_note-22) In _[Associated Press v. Meltwater U.S. Holdings, Inc.](/wiki/Associated_Press_v._Meltwater_U.S._Holdings,_Inc. "Associated Press v. Meltwater U.S. Holdings, Inc.")_, a court in the US held Meltwater liable for scraping and republishing news information from the Associated Press, but a court in the United Kingdom held in favor of Meltwater.

The [Ninth Circuit](/wiki/Ninth_Circuit "Ninth Circuit") ruled in 2019 that web scraping did not violate the CFAA in _[hiQ Labs v. LinkedIn](/wiki/HiQ_Labs_v._LinkedIn "HiQ Labs v. LinkedIn")_. The case was appealed to the [United States Supreme Court](/wiki/United_States_Supreme_Court "United States Supreme Court"), which returned the case to the Ninth Circuit to reconsider the case in light of the 2021 Supreme Court decision in _[Van Buren v. United States](/wiki/Van_Buren_v._United_States "Van Buren v. United States")_ which narrowed the applicability of the CFAA.[\[23\]](#cite_note-23) On this review, the Ninth Circuit upheld their prior decision.[\[24\]](#cite_note-24)

[Internet Archive](/wiki/Internet_Archive "Internet Archive") collects and distributes a significant number of publicly available web pages without being considered to be in violation of copyright laws.\[_[citation needed](/wiki/Wikipedia:Citation_needed "Wikipedia:Citation needed")_\]

### European Union

\[[edit](/w/index.php?title=Web_scraping&action=edit&section=14 "Edit section: European Union")\]

In February 2006, the [Danish Maritime and Commercial Court](/wiki/Maritime_and_Commercial_Court_\(Denmark\) "Maritime and Commercial Court (Denmark)") (Copenhagen) ruled that systematic crawling, indexing, and deep linking by portal site ofir.dk of real estate site Home.dk does not conflict with Danish law or the database directive of the European Union.[\[25\]](#cite_note-25)

Ethical data scraping supports offmarket sourcing in business but must comply with GDPR to avoid privacy violations in automated data collection.[\[26\]](#cite_note-26)

In a February 2010 case complicated by matters of jurisdiction, Ireland's High Court delivered a verdict that illustrates the [inchoate](/wiki/Inchoate_offense "Inchoate offense") state of developing case law. In the case of _Ryanair Ltd v Billigfluege.de GmbH_, Ireland's High Court ruled [Ryanair's](/wiki/Ryanair "Ryanair") "[click-wrap](/wiki/Clickwrap "Clickwrap")" agreement to be legally binding. In contrast to the findings of the United States District Court Eastern District of Virginia and those of the Danish Maritime and Commercial Court, Justice [Michael Hanna](/wiki/Michael_Hanna_\(judge\) "Michael Hanna (judge)") ruled that the hyperlink to Ryanair's terms and conditions was plainly visible, and that placing the onus on the user to agree to terms and conditions in order to gain access to online services is sufficient to comprise a contractual relationship.[\[27\]](#cite_note-27) The decision is under appeal in Ireland's Supreme Court.[\[28\]](#cite_note-28)

On April 30, 2020, the French Data Protection Authority (CNIL) released new guidelines on web scraping.[\[29\]](#cite_note-29) The CNIL guidelines made it clear that publicly available data is still personal data and cannot be repurposed without the knowledge of the person to whom that data belongs.[\[30\]](#cite_note-30)

### Australia

\[[edit](/w/index.php?title=Web_scraping&action=edit&section=15 "Edit section: Australia")\]

In Australia, the [Spam Act 2003](/wiki/Spam_Act_2003 "Spam Act 2003") outlaws some forms of web harvesting, although this only applies to email addresses.[\[31\]](#cite_note-31)[\[32\]](#cite_note-32)

### India

\[[edit](/w/index.php?title=Web_scraping&action=edit&section=16 "Edit section: India")\]

Leaving a few cases dealing with IPR infringement, Indian courts have not expressly ruled on the legality of web scraping. However, since all common forms of electronic contracts are enforceable in India, violating the terms of use prohibiting data scraping will be a violation of the contract law. It will also violate the [Information Technology Act, 2000](/wiki/Information_Technology_Act,_2000#:~:text=From_Wikipedia,_the_free_encyclopedia_The_Information_Technology,in_India_dealing_with_cybercrime_and_electronic_commerce. "Information Technology Act, 2000"), which penalizes unauthorized access to a computer resource or extracting data from a computer resource.

Methods to prevent web scraping

-------------------------------

\[[edit](/w/index.php?title=Web_scraping&action=edit&section=17 "Edit section: Methods to prevent web scraping")\]

The administrator of a website can use various measures to stop or slow a bot. Some techniques include:

*   Blocking an [IP address](/wiki/IP_address "IP address") either manually or based on criteria such as [geolocation](/wiki/Geolocation "Geolocation") and [DNSRBL](/wiki/DNSBL "DNSBL"). This will also block all browsing from that address.

*   Disabling any [web service](/wiki/Web_service "Web service") [API](/wiki/Application_programming_interface "Application programming interface") that the website's system might expose.

*   Bots sometimes declare who they are (using [user agent](/wiki/User_agent "User agent") [strings](/wiki/String_\(computer_science\) "String (computer science)")) and can be blocked on that basis using [robots.txt](/wiki/Robots_exclusion_standard "Robots exclusion standard"); '[googlebot](/wiki/Googlebot "Googlebot")' is an example. Other bots make no distinction between themselves and a human using a browser.

*   Bots can be blocked by monitoring excess traffic.

*   Bots can sometimes be blocked with tools to verify that it is a real person accessing the site, like a [CAPTCHA](/wiki/CAPTCHA "CAPTCHA"). Bots are sometimes coded to explicitly break specific CAPTCHA patterns or may employ third-party services that utilize human labor to read and respond in real-time to CAPTCHA challenges. They can be triggered because the bot is: 1) making too many requests in a short time, 2) using low-quality proxies, or 3) not covering the web scraper’s fingerprint properly.[\[33\]](#cite_note-33)

*   Commercial anti-bot services: Companies offer anti-bot and anti-scraping services for websites. A few web [application firewalls](/wiki/Application_firewall "Application firewall") have limited bot detection capabilities as well. However, many such solutions are not very effective.[\[34\]](#cite_note-34)

*   Locating bots with a [honeypot](/wiki/Honeypot_\(computing\) "Honeypot (computing)") or other method to identify the IP addresses of automated crawlers.

*   [Obfuscation](/wiki/Obfuscation "Obfuscation") using [CSS sprites](/wiki/CSS_sprite "CSS sprite") to display such data as telephone numbers or email addresses, at the cost of [accessibility](/wiki/Web_accessibility "Web accessibility") to [screen reader](/wiki/Screen_reader "Screen reader") users.

*   Because bots rely on consistency in the front-end code of a target website, adding small variations to the HTML/CSS surrounding important data and navigation elements would require more human involvement in the initial set up of a bot and if done effectively may render the target website too difficult to scrape due to the diminished ability to automate the scraping process.[\[35\]](#cite_note-35)

*   Websites can declare if crawling is allowed or not in the [robots.txt](/wiki/Robots_exclusion_standard "Robots exclusion standard") file and allow partial access, limit the crawl rate, specify the optimal time to crawl and more.

*   Trapping bots in a [tarpit](/wiki/Tarpit_\(networking\) "Tarpit (networking)"), feeding them nonsensical data to [poison their dataset](/wiki/Data_poisoning "Data poisoning"). This method is particularly effective against bots which ignore robots.txt files.[\[36\]](#cite_note-36)

Web scraping is my favorite area of coding. It’s both incredibly frustrating and extremely rewarding. The best thing about scraping is that the possibilities are endless. There’s virtually infinite data on the internet, and a lot of it is super easy to collect with a simple scraper.

Getting started is very easy. When I began, I had only written a few lines of code in my entire life, but I had the idea to [scrape mortgage interest rates](https://www.homesliceapp.ai/interest-rates) to watch their trend in real time. After a quick Google search and about 20 minutes later, I had built my first web scraper. I want to help others do the same!

I typically use either Python or JavaScript/TypeScript. Both are great options, it’s mostly a matter of preference. In this guide I’ll go over very simple examples for both.

Prerequisites:

*   [Python](https://www.python.org/downloads/) or [Node.js](https://nodejs.org/en/download) installed on your machine depending on your language of choice.

*   An IDE — I prefer [PyCharm](https://www.jetbrains.com/pycharm/download/?section=mac) for Python and [VSCode](https://code.visualstudio.com/download) for JavaScript/TypeScript.

*   If you’d like, you can follow along with my code using the GitHub repo I set up for this guide: [https://github.com/thejoeosborne/simple-scraper](https://github.com/thejoeosborne/simple-scraper)

That’s it! Let’s get started.

Step 1

------

Create a new folder on your machine and a new .js or .py file inside the folder. Let’s name them `scraper-python.py`and `scraper-javascript.js`. Open up the folder in your IDE of choice.

We’ll quickly download a couple libraries to help us out.

If using Python, open up a terminal and run `pip install requests` and `pip install beautifulsoup4` .

If using JavaScript, run `npm init` and `npm install cheerio` .

For TypeScript specifically, you should run `npm install ts-node` which will allow you to run the scraper later.

Step 2

------

Choose a website to scrape and make a network request to the website. For this guide, we’ll scrape [example.com](https://example.com/) because it’s very simple and doesn’t have any blocking or authentication. Higher traffic sites like LinkedIn, Indeed, etc are notoriously difficult to scrape due to sophisticated bot detection.

In our code, we’ll make a simple `GET` request to example.com. The website will send us back its HTML. In this step, we’ll just print the HTML to the console. Later, we’ll parse out specific pieces of it.

Python:

\# scraper-python.py  

\# To run this script, paste \`python scraper-python.py\` in the terminal  

import requests  

from bs4 import BeautifulSoup  

def scrape():  

    url = 'https://www.example.com'  

    response = requests.get(url)  

    soup = BeautifulSoup(response.text, 'html.parser')  

    print(soup)  

if \_\_name\_\_ == '\_\_main\_\_':  

    scrape()

JavaScript:

/\*\*  

 \* scraper-javascript.js  

 \* To run this script, copy and paste \`node scraper-javascript.js\` in the terminal  

 \*/  

const cheerio = require('cheerio');  

(async () => {  

  const url = 'https://www.example.com';  

  const response = await fetch(url);  

  const $ = cheerio.load(await response.text());  

  console.log($.html());  

})();

Go ahead and run your script by pasting either `python scraper-python.py` or `node scraper-javascript.js` in your terminal. Here’s the result you should get from printing the HTML:

Nice! You made a network request to the website, and got back the HTML. Now, let’s parse out specific parts of the page.

Step 3

------

`BeautifulSoup` and `cheerio` are libraries that help us navigate HTML in code. They allow us to pass in certain paths and patterns to get certain snippets of HTML.

Let’s go ahead and capture 3 things from this page: The title, the text, and the “More information…” link.

Press enter or click to view image in full size

We’ll use CSS Selectors to find these elements in the HTML. CSS Selectors are notations used to locate HTML elements, and they are very easy to learn. [Here’s a cheatsheet you can use](https://www.w3schools.com/cssref/css_selectors.php). The ones we will use for this guide are very simple, but it’s worth your time to get familiar with more complex ones when scraping real websites. Figuring out the right selector is usually not too hard, and I constantly use Google and ChatGPT to help me come up with good ones.

Let’s capture the title, text, and extract the link from the `<a>` tag. Add these lines to your code.

Python:

title = soup.select\_one('h1').text  

text = soup.select\_one('p').text  

link = soup.select\_one('a').get('href')  

print(title)  

print(text)  

print(link)

JavaScript:

const title = $('h1').text();  

const text = $('p').text();  

const link = $('a').attr('href');  

console.log(title);  

console.log(text);  

console.log(link);

After adding those lines to your script and running it, the console should print out this text:

What is Web Scraping and How to Use It?

=======================================

Last Updated : 12 Nov, 2025

Web scraping is an automated method to extract large amounts of data from websites. This data, usually in HTML format, is converted into structured formats like spreadsheets or databases for further use. It can be done through online tools, APIs, or custom code. While major websites like Google, Twitter, and Facebook offer APIs for structured data access, web scraping is often used for sites that lack such options or restrict data access.

Web scraping involves two main components:

*   ****Crawler:**** An AI algorithm that navigates the web and follows links to find the required data.

*   ****Scraper:**** A tool designed to extract the identified data from websites, with its design varying based on the project’s complexity and scope.

How Web Scrapers Work?

----------------------

Web Scrapers can extract all the data on particular sites or the specific data that a user wants. Ideally, it’s best if you specify the data you want so that the web scraper only extracts that data quickly. For example, you might want to scrape an Amazon page for the types of juicers available, but you might only want the data about the models of different juicers and not the customer reviews. 

****Web Scraping End-to-End Flow****

*   ****Input****: Give URLs + specify what data you want (e.g., product name & price only).

*   ****Request****: Scraper visits each URL like a browser (sends HTTP GET).

*   ****Load****: Downloads HTML (runs JavaScript if needed for dynamic pages).

*   ****Parse****: Turns HTML into a navigable structure.

*   ****Extract****: Finds & pulls only the targeted data using selectors/XPath.

*   ****Clean****: Trims, converts, and organizes data into rows.

*   ****Paginate****: Follows “Next” links and repeats until done.

*   ****Save****: Exports clean data as CSV, Excel, JSON, or database.

Types of Web Scrapers

---------------------

Web Scrapers can be categorized based on different criteria such as development type, platform, and execution environment.

### ****Based on Development Type****

*   ****Self-built Web Scrapers****

    *   Created from scratch using programming languages like Python or JavaScript.

    *   Require advanced coding knowledge.

    *   Offer full customization and flexibility.

    *   More features demand deeper technical expertise.

*   ****Pre-built Web Scrapers****

    *   Already developed tools that can be easily downloaded and run.

    *   Offer user-friendly interfaces and advanced customization options.

    *   Suitable for users with little or no coding experience.

### ****Based on Platform****

*   ****Browser Extension Web Scrapers****

    *   Installed directly as extensions in browsers like Chrome or Firefox.

    *   Easy to use and quick to set up.

    *   Limited by browser capabilities — cannot perform complex or large-scale scraping tasks.

*   ****Software Web Scrapers****

    *   Standalone applications installed on your computer.

    *   More advanced and feature-rich than browser-based scrapers.

    *   Not limited by browser restrictions but require installation and system resources.

### ****Based on Execution Environment****

*   ****Cloud Web Scrapers****

    *   Operate on cloud servers provided by scraper vendors.

    *   Don’t use your computer’s CPU or RAM.

    *   Allow multitasking since data scraping runs remotely.

*   ****Local Web Scrapers****

    *   Run directly on your own computer.

    *   Depend on local system resources (CPU, RAM).

    *   May slow down your system during heavy scraping tasks.

Why is Python a Popular Programming Language for Web Scraping?

--------------------------------------------------------------

[Python](https://www.geeksforgeeks.org/python/python-programming-language-tutorial/) seems to be in fashion these days! It is the most popular language for web scraping as it can handle most of the processes easily. It also has a variety of libraries that were created specifically for Web Scraping. [Scrapy](https://www.scrapy.org/) is a very popular open-source web crawling framework that is written in Python. It is ideal for web scraping as well as extracting data using APIs. [Beautiful soup](https://pypi.org/project/beautifulsoup4/) is another Python library that is highly suitable for Web Scraping. It creates a parse tree that can be used to extract data from HTML on a website. Beautiful soup also has multiple features for navigation, searching, and modifying these parse trees.

What is Web Scraping Used for?

------------------------------

Web Scraping has multiple applications across various industries. Let’s check out some of these now!

### 1\. Price Monitoring

Web Scraping can be used by companies to scrap the product data for their products and competing products as well to see how it impacts their pricing strategies. Companies can use this data to fix the optimal pricing for their products so that they can obtain maximum revenue.

### 2\. Market Research

Web scraping can be used for market research by companies. High-quality web scraped data obtained in large volumes can be very helpful for companies in analyzing consumer trends and understanding which direction the company should move in the future. 

### 3\. News Monitoring

Web scraping news sites can provide detailed reports on the current news to a company. This is even more essential for companies that are frequently in the news or that depend on daily news for their day-to-day functioning. After all, news reports can make or break a company in a single day!

### 4\. Sentiment Analysis

If companies want to understand the general sentiment for their products among their consumers, then Sentiment Analysis is a must. Companies can use web scraping to collect data from social media websites such as Facebook and Twitter as to what the general sentiment about their products is. This will help them in creating products that people desire and moving ahead of their competition.

### 5\. Email Marketing

Companies can also use Web scraping for email marketing. They can collect Email ID’s from various sites using web scraping and then send bulk promotional and marketing Emails to all the people owning these Email ID’s.

This is particularly important for conducting market research, facilitating lead generation for sales and marketing teams, and enabling price monitoring for competitive retail and travel businesses.

web scraping diagram

Web scraping plays a pivotal role in supplying data for machine learning models, furthering the advancement of AI technology. For instance, scraping images from websites can feed computer vision algorithms, textual data can be used for natural language processing models, and customer behavior data can enhance recommendation systems. By automating the data collection process and scaling it to gather information from a wide range of sources, web scraping helps in creating robust, accurate, and well-trained AI models.

Web scraping is especially useful if the public website you want to get data from doesn’t have an API, or only provides limited access to web data.  

In such scenarios, where traditional methods fall short, leveraging external web scraping services like [Zyte](https://www.zyte.com/) can be a strategic approach. These services offer a more efficient and scalable solution, enabling businesses to extract the necessary data seamlessly.

**What is web scraping?**

-------------------------

Web scraping is the process of collecting unstructured and structured data in an automated manner. It’s also widely known as web data extraction or web data scraping.

Some of the main use cases of web scraping include price monitoring, [price intelligence](https://www.zyte.com/learn/price-intelligence/), news monitoring, [lead generation](https://www.zyte.com/learn/lead-generation/), and [market research](https://www.zyte.com/learn/market-research/) among many others.

In general, it is used by people and businesses who want to make use of publicly available web data to generate valuable insights and make smarter decisions.

If you’ve ever copied and pasted information from a website, you’ve performed the same function as any web scraper, only you manually went through the data scraping process. Unlike the tedious process of extracting data by yourself, web scraping uses machine learning and intelligent automation to retrieve hundreds, millions, or even billions of extracted data points from the internet’s seemingly endless frontier.

Whether you’re using a web scraper to get web data or outsourcing the project to a web data extraction partner, you’ll need to know a bit more about the basics of web scraping or web data extraction.

**The basics of web data extraction**

-------------------------------------

A web scraper automates the process of extracting information from other websites, quickly and accurately. The data extracted is delivered in a structured format, making it easier to analyze and use in your projects. The process is extremely simple and works by way of two parts: a web crawler and a web scraper.

The web crawler is the horse, and the scraper is the chariot.

The crawler leads the scraper, as if by hand, through the internet, where it extracts the data requested.

### Difference between web scraping and web crawling

### **The crawler**

A web crawler, which we generally call a “spider,” is an artificial intelligence that browses the internet to index and search for content by following links and exploring. In many projects, you first “crawl” the web or one specific website to discover URLs which then you pass on to your scraper.

### **The scraper**

A web scraper is a specialized tool designed to accurately and quickly extract data from a web page. Web data scraping tools vary widely in design and complexity, depending on the project.

An important part of every web scraper is the selectors that are used to find the data that you want to extract from the HTML file - usually, XPath, CSS selectors, regex, or a combination of them is applied.

Understanding the difference between a web crawler and a scraper will help you move forward with your web extraction projects.

[Learn the difference between a web crawler and a web scraper](https://www.zyte.com/learn/difference-between-web-scraping-and-web-crawling/)

Want to know more about how Zyte's web scraping expertise can add value to your web scraping project? [Reach out to us](https://www.zyte.com/talk-to-us/.).

**The web scraping process**

----------------------------

Web scraping can be immensely valuable for generating insights. There are two ways to get web data:

### Do it yourself using website scraping tools

This is what a general DIY [web scraping process](https://www.zyte.com/learn/architecting-a-web-scraping-solution/) looks like:

1.  Identify the target website

2.  Collect URLs of the target pages

3.  Make a request to these URLs to get the HTML of the page

4.  Use locators to find the information in the HTML

5.  Save the data in a JSON or CSV file or some other structured format

Simple enough, right? It is!

That is, if you just have a small project.

But unfortunately, there are quite a few challenges you need to tackle if you need to [extract data at scale](https://www.zyte.com/learn/how-to-scale-up-web-scraping/).

For example, maintaining data extraction tools and web scrapers if the website layout changes, [managing proxies](https://www.zyte.com/smart-proxy-manager/), executing javascript, or working around antibots. These are all technical problems that use up internal resources.

There are multiple open-source web scraping tools that you can use but they all have their limitations.

That’s part of the reason many businesses choose to outsource their web data projects.

**Outsourcing with Zyte**

-------------------------

1.  Our team gathers your requirements regarding your project.

2.  Our veteran team of web data scraping experts writes the scraper(s) and sets up the infrastructure to collect your data and structure it based on your requirements.

3.  Finally, we deliver it in your desired format and desired frequency.

Ultimately, the flexibility and scalability of web scraping ensure your project parameters, no matter how specific, can be met with ease.

E-commerce business intelligence managers inform their retail unit with competitor pricing based on web-scraped insights, investors research, evaluate and analyze opportunities to invest, and marketing teams overwhelm the competition with deep insights, all thanks to the burgeoning adoption of web scraping as an intrinsic part of everyday business.

Outsourcing your web scraping is usually the way to go for companies that rely on insights from web data.

### 3 reasons why you should outsource your web scraping

1.  High data quality - Web data providers like Zyte have state-of-the-art infrastructure, talented developers, and tons of experience that ensures there is no missing or incorrect data.

2.  Low cost - Getting web data from expert providers can be expensive but compared to the cost of building an in-house infrastructure and hiring multiple developers and engineers, outsourcing is the more cost-effective option.

3.  Legal Compliance - You may not be aware of all the dos and don't of web scraping but a web data provider with an in-house legal team certainly will. Outsourcing will ensure you always stay legally compliant.

If you still want to try managing it in-house, you'll want to know about the tools that will help you access web data.

### **What is a web scraping tool?**

A web scraping tool is a software program designed to extract (or ‘web scrape’) relevant data from websites. You’ll almost certainly be using some kind of web scraper to extract specific datasets when collecting relevant data from websites.

A scraping tool, or website scraper, is used as part of the web scraping process to make HTTP requests on a target website and extract web data from a page. It parses content that is publicly accessible and visible to users and rendered by the server as HTML.

Sometimes it also makes requests to internal application programming interfaces (APIs) for associated data – like product prices or contact details – that are stored in a database and delivered to a browser via HTTP requests.

There are various kinds of web scrapers and data extraction tools like [Zyte Automatic Extraction](https://www.zyte.com/automated-data-extraction/), with capabilities that can be customized to suit different data extraction projects.

### **What is a web scraping tool used for?**

You might need a web scraping tool to recognize unique HTML site structures, or extract data, reformat data, and store data from APIs.

Web scraping tools can be large frameworks designed for all kinds of typical scraping tasks, but you can also use general-purpose programming libraries and combine them to create a scraper.

For example, you might use an HTTP requests library - such as the Python-Requests library - and combine it with the Python BeautifulSoup library to scrape data from your page. Or you may use a dedicated framework that combines an HTTP client with an HTML parsing library.

One popular example is [Scrapy](https://scrapy.org/), an open-source framework created for advanced scraping needs.

### **What can I use instead of a data scraping tool?**

For all but the smallest projects, you’ll need some kind of automated web scraping tool or data extraction software to obtain information from websites.

In theory, you could manually cut and paste information from individual web pages into a spreadsheet or another document. But you’ll find this to be laborious, time-consuming, and error-prone if you’re trying to extract information from hundreds or thousands of pages. 

Web scraping applications and website scrapers, automate the process, extracting the web data you need and formatting it in a structured format for storage and further processing.

Another route for data scraping, is actually buying the [web data you need](https://www.zyte.com/data-extraction/) from a data services provider like Zyte, who will extract it on your behalf. This would be extremely useful for big projects involving tens of thousands of web pages.

### The value of scraping data

Web scraping provides something really valuable that nothing else can: **it gives you structured web data from any public website.**

More than a modern convenience, the true power of web data scraping lies in its ability to build and power some of the world’s most revolutionary business applications.

‘Transformative’ doesn’t even begin to describe the way some companies use web-scraped data to enhance their operations, informing executive decisions all the way down to individual customer service experiences.

**What is web scraping used for?**

----------------------------------

### Price Intelligence

In our experience, price intelligence is the biggest use case for web scraping.

Extracting product and pricing information from e-commerce websites, then turning it into intelligence is an important part of modern e-commerce companies that want to make better pricing/marketing decisions based on data.

Web pricing data and price intelligence benefits:

*   Dynamic pricing

*   Revenue optimization

*   Competitor monitoring

*   Product trend monitoring

*   Brand and MAP compliance

### Market research

Market research is critical – and should be driven by the most accurate information available. With data scraping, you get high quality, high volume, and highly insightful web-scraped data of every shape and size is fueling market analysis and business intelligence across the globe.

*   Market trend analysis

*   Market pricing

*   Optimizing point of entry

*   Research & development

### Lead generation

Lead generation is a crucial marketing/sales activity for all businesses.

In the 2020 [Hubspot report,](https://www.hubspot.com/marketing-statistics?__hstc=199723825.fd8464031d37bb100d4791dfaab396f1.1673436330780.1678382559298.1678392583327.49&__hssc=199723825.1.1678392583327&__hsfp=3676364651) 61% of inbound marketers said generating traffic and leads was their number 1 challenge. Fortunately, web data extraction can be used to get access to structured lead lists from the web.

### Brand monitoring

In today’s highly competitive market, it's a top priority to protect your online reputation.

Whether you sell your products online and have a strict pricing policy that you need to enforce or just want to know how people perceive your products online,[brand monitoring with web scraping](https://www.zyte.com/brand-monitoring/) can give you this kind of information.

### Business automation

In some situations, it can be cumbersome to get access to your data. Maybe you need to extract data from a website that is your own or your partner’s in a structured way.

But there’s no easy internal way to do it and it makes sense to create a scraper and simply grab that data. As opposed to trying to work your way through complicated internal systems.

### MAP monitoring

Minimum advertised price (MAP) monitoring is the standard practice to make sure a brand’s online prices are aligned with its pricing policy.

With tons of resellers and distributors, it’s impossible to monitor the prices manually.

That’s why web scraping comes in handy because you can keep an eye on your products’ prices without lifting a finger.

#### **Other uses for web data extraction**

The endless methods and applications for web data extraction don’t end there.

Web data scraping is widely used for:

*   News, journalism, and reputation monitoring

*   SEO Monitoring

*   Competitor analysis and risk management

*   Data-driven marketing and lead generation

*   Real estate, academic research, and much more.

**How can I web scrape a site for free?**

-----------------------------------------

There are various free web data scraping solutions available to automate the process of scraping content and extracting data from the web. These range from simple point-and-click scraping solutions aimed at non-specialists to more powerful developer-focused applications with extensive configuration and management options.

If you’re viewing a website – just as you’re doing now – you could simply cut and paste the information you’re reading on screen into another document like a spreadsheet. It’s certainly one way of extracting web data for free. But collecting data and gathering information manually this way is slow, inefficient, and error-prone.

In practice you’ll be looking at ways to automate this process, allowing you to extract web data from multiple web pages – maybe thousands or millions of them per day – and organize the results in a structured format.

To achieve this you’ll need some kind of web data extraction tool, often known as a web scraper.

There are plenty of free web scraping solutions out there to extract data from the web. Some of these are dedicated applications aimed firmly at programmers, requiring a level of coding proficiency to configure and manage.  

For those without coding knowledge, Google Sheets' "importHTML" function provides an easy and free option for importing data from HTML content. However, this method is very limited in its ability to scrape multiple pages and preprocessing.

For more complex web scraping needs, users can turn to Python code or online services that provide pre-built scripts for web extraction. These services can be useful for extracting data from a single page, but may not be ideal for scraping multiple pages or extracting more complex data. For these scenarios, coding knowledge is typically required to write custom scripts to access and extract the necessary data.

Ultimately, the best approach to web scraping depends on the specific project and the level of coding expertise available.

With that said, are free web scraping tools and web scrapers efficient?

They are ideal for non-specialists and hobbyists with moderate extraction needs.

There are also some easy-to-use scrapers that run as a browser extension or plug-in with a simple point-and-click interface. Less sophisticated than their developer-focused counterparts, they’re typically more limited in the variety and volume of data they let you scrape.

Web scraping, or web data extraction, is the process of [extracting publicly available web data](https://www.scraperapi.com/blog/is-web-scraping-legal/) using automated tools – web scrapers. This information is usually returned in a structured format and used for repurposing or analysis. Businesses use this data to build new solutions like apps and websites or make better decisions based on patterns and insights from the collected data.

In this article, we’ll explore:

*   What web scraping is

*   What is web scraping used for

*   How do web scrapers work

*   The different types of web scrapers available

And some practical examples of web scrapers.

What is Web Scraping?

---------------------

Web scraping is a process where data, or any essential piece of information, is automatically collected from a website for the purpose of enabling humans, programs, or AI models to make more informed decisions.

Some popular websites, such as StackOverflow, have API endpoints for analysts or engineers to get structured data (e.g., Excel or JSON) extracted easily. But, this is not the case for every website, and this is where web scraping becomes more important.

Most of the time, a large chunk of data is needed while doing research. However, it can be extremely tedious to fish and extract these pieces of information one after the other manually.

Another option is to screenshot data, but the downsides of that include the inability to structure data or feed it into programs. For this reason, it is unarguably better and more efficient to scrape data from websites.

The automation aspect of web scraping is introduced with the use of programs—which can be developed in Python, JavaScript, or any other languages—to automatically search the web for the provided URL and extract the data there.

Professionally, scraping data is not enough; it should also come in a structured format and be in a separate file; all these can be well-defined in the program.

That said, the success of web scraping is not only dependent on writing programs, as various websites have many sophisticated bot-bouncing measures in place. This is the reason hyper-efficient web scraping APIs, such as ScraperAPI, become an important weapon in any web scraper’s arsenal.

Web scraping tools or web scrapers are software solutions designed specifically to access, scrape, and organize hundreds, thousands, or even millions of data points from websites and APIs and export the data into a useful format – typically a CSV or JSON file.

These tools can either be out-of-the-box solutions (pre-built scrapers) or scripts built using a programming language and their corresponding scraping libraries (like [Python’s Beautiful Soup](https://www.scraperapi.com/web-scraping/python/) or [JavaScript’s Cheerios.](https://www.scraperapi.com/web-scraping/javascript/)

How Does a Web Scraper Work?

----------------------------

A web scraper is an automated tool that extracts data from a list of URLs based on pre-set criteria. They are used to gather information to find names, prices, addresses, and other data, then export that information into a usable format like a spreadsheet or a database.

They’re used for use cases like finding property listings for real estate, conducting market research, gathering intelligence on competitors, etc.

**There are two main components to a web scraper, the web crawler and the scraper itself:**

*   **Web crawler:** the web crawler is functionally similar to a search engine bot in that it follows a list of links and catalogs the information, then it visits all the links it can find within the current page and subsequent pages until it hits a specified limit (or there are no more links to follow). Once given a seed list of URLs, it goes down the list one by one. [Scrapy](https://www.scraperapi.com/web-scraping/scrapy/) is a common tool for web crawling.

*   **Web scraper:** once the program visits the web page, it parses the code on the web page to get the information it needs. Most web scrapers will parse the HTML code on the page, but more advanced web scrapers will also fully render (similar to how web browsers do) the CSS and Javascript on the page. Once it extracts the data it needs, it exports that data and stores it – usually on a .sql, .xls, or .csv file.

A Simple Example

----------------

Let’s say that you want to create a Twitter bot that publishes quotes from humanity’s greatest minds. You could definitely read a lot of books and manually create a database with all the quotes your bot will use, or better yet, you can scrape all the phrases from different websites and automate the whole process.

For this scenario, we’ll build a simple scraper that extracts the quotes from the first page of `https://quotes.toscrape.com/` using Python and Beautiful Soup:

					`import requests from bs4 import BeautifulSoup url = 'https://quotes.toscrape.com/'  response = requests.get(url) soup = BeautifulSoup(response.content, 'html.parser')  all_quotes = soup.find_all('div', class_= 'quote') for quote in all_quotes: quote_text = quote.find('span', class_= 'text').text print(quote_text)`

**Note:** If you’d like to learn how to build a scraper from scratch, check out our [Python web scraping tutorial for beginners](https://www.scraperapi.com/blog/scrapy-web-scraping/) or take one of the [best web scraping courses for Python and JavaScript](https://www.scraperapi.com/blog/best-web-scraping-courses/)

Of course, this is just a form web scrapers can take.

In other scenarios, you might want to use technologies like Selenium to [control a headless browser and scrape dynamic content](https://www.scraperapi.com/blog/scrape-dynamic-content/). In others, using a scraping API like ScraperAPI would let you [automate data collection](https://www.scraperapi.com/solutions/data-pipeline/) or even extract data in real-time from platforms like Amazon.

What Can Web Scrapers Be Used For?

----------------------------------

After understanding what web scraping is all about, it is brilliant to ask what exactly it is used for and if you can also find it useful in your business endeavors. For clarity, here are current use cases of web scraping in several domains:

1\. Training AI models

----------------------

Large Language Models (LLMs), such as ChatGPT and Claude, are only as intelligent as the dataset they were trained on; the larger and more diverse the data, the better. Hence, AI and machine learning companies often spend more time and resources [scraping data to train their LLMs](https://www.scraperapi.com/solutions/ai-data/). 

For example, if a model is to be trained on debugging, relevant questions on it across StackOverflow, StackExchange, and Reddit must be properly scraped, analyzed, and fed into the dataset.

Once the dataset is robust enough, the intelligence of the LLM will be more impressive.

2\. Lead generation

-------------------

Businesses that want to keep growing must retain their users and always be on the hunt for more; this is what lead generation is all about.

With web scraping, businesses are able to get the work email of their target audience and try to seal partnerships or close sales with them. This data can be extracted from publicly available platforms.

With a simple scraping program, a business can get the details of thousands of leads. This would have been extremely difficult and time-consuming if attempted to be done manually.

3\. Sentimental analysis

------------------------

Humans are emotional beings, and a good number of their decisions are based on emotions. This can be a source of truth for aggregating possible outcomes of events.

For example, an insurance company might want to know what the people in a location feel about insurance generally. It can create a program and scrape tweets mentioning that keyword within a particular time frame in such a location.

After extracting these data, the company might visualize the data to know the state of sentiment about its services. This also applies to other industries.

4\. Market research and competitors analysis

--------------------------------------------

The way to stay at the top in business is to often take a few steps back to review, research, and analyze. Another way to speed up this research is to see what customers are buying from your competitors and why they choose them over you.

Web scraping can help businesses make data-driven decisions, such as allowing reviews and prices of goods to be extracted from competitors’ websites.

**This way, business leaders can spot:**  

*   Products competitors offer that they do not

*   If there is something about the pricing that makes customers keep going to their competitors

*   What the customers love about competitors, as seen in the reviews

5\. Financial price monitoring

------------------------------

Some companies invest in various asset classes, such as bonds, stocks, and crypto. Therefore, it is imperative to monitor how these assets are performing from time to time; this will be helpful in spotting market trends and making apt financial decisions accordingly.

For convenience, scraping scripts can be run to alert when your asset hits certain figures on the chart, which is easier than always checking the chart manually.

It is also the case that some hedge funds and trading companies run scraping programs to spot arbitrage opportunities for some assets.

What are the different types of web scrapers?

---------------------------------------------

1\. The builder

---------------

Web scrapers can be differentiated based on who built them. There are a couple of options:

#### Personally built web scrapers

Anyone with technical knowledge can write a web scraping program. Bear in mind that sometimes, basic engineering skills and knowledge of how the web works won’t be enough.

Hence, there is a need to be more sophisticated in development to write complex programs and bypass high-level anti-scraping agents.

#### Whitelabel web scrapers (or pre-built scrapers)

In this case, the web scraping program is already written and can be customized by whoever wants to run it.

For example, a whitelabel scraper might have been written for LinkedIn pages, only that whoever wants to run it must provide a targeted link as well as other details. This can be more helpful for non-technical business leaders or for tech teams to build on top of it.

2\. Application type

--------------------

#### Browser Extensions

Web scraping extensions are simple programs (or add-ons) installed on top of your browser. These extensions use your browser’s capabilities to extract extra data from the sites you’re visiting.

The major advantage of these extensions is that they can collect dynamic data using your browser’s rendering engine, making it easier to collect data from JavaScript-heavy sites.

However, advanced features like IP rotation and CAPTCHA handling can’t be implemented because these applications live on your browser, so these are better suited for small scraping projects or to get sample data to pitch a project.

#### Software

On the other hand, software-based web scrapers can live on your local machine or in the cloud, giving more flexibility and more advanced features necessary to collect data at scale.

You can also consider scraping APIs, like [ScraperAPI](https://www.scraperapi.com/solutions/scraping-api/), as software applications. These tools, unlike browser extensions, have more automation and scalability options and can be integrated into complex data pipelines.

3\. The interface

-----------------

Generally, the interface can be with a:

*   **Graphic User Interface (GUI):** This is more about clicking on buttons and ticking boxes to instruct the scraper on what the user wants – e.g., our visual scraper, [DataPipeline](https://www.scraperapi.com/solutions/data-pipeline/).

*   **Command Line Interface (CLI):** This involves writing and interacting with the scraping program from the terminal.

4\. Where it runs

-----------------

Where a web scraper run matters and is, in fact, a category. A web scraper can run on either:

*   **The cloud:** The web scraper runs on servers, thus making the scraping jobs run outside of the local machine for efficiency – e.g., our [Async Scraper](https://www.scraperapi.com/solutions/asynchronous-scraper-service/).

*   **Local machine:** the only drawback is that the scraping might be quite slow if the machine doesn’t have enough storage and a fast internet connection.

Is Web Scraping Legal?

----------------------

Web scraping is legal so far the extracted data are neither personal nor copyrighted. In most jurisdictions, web scraping is legal if the data is obtained in good faith, without causing harm, and utilized for a good cause. So make sure to check the site’s robots.txt file to ensure you’re not surpassing rate limits that could overwhelm its servers.

This is understandable, as public data can be needed for research and analyses.

In quite a recent lawsuit between [Meta vs BrightData](https://techcrunch.com/2024/01/24/court-rules-in-favor-of-a-web-scraper-bright-data-which-meta-had-used-and-then-sued/), the court dismissed the case and held Meta did not sufficiently prove that BrightData scraped nothing other than publicly available data.

Having said that, it is important to mention that web scraping can be considered illegal under two important conditions: personal data and copyrighted data.

According to the provisions of GDPR, personal data should not be scraped without consent. Similarly, once a website has copyrighted its content, they have secured the intellectual property of the data therein and, therefore, making it illegal to scrape.

On this note, motive and usage are two important factors that can determine whether or not web scraping is legal.

FAQ About Web Scraping

----------------------

Is web scraping still used?

Yes, web scraping is still used by individuals who want to use data for personal reasons, businesses that want to make data-driven commercial decisions, and even AI companies that want to make their models more intelligent.

Is web scraping detectable?

Yes, web scraping can be detectable by the scraper’s fingerprint and browser behaviors. At the same time, it can be quite undetectable when the scraper uses rotating proxies to simulate different locations by distributing your traffic through multiple IP addresses.

Can a website block web scraping?

Yes, a website can use CAPTCHA challenges and other mechanisms of authenticating humanness to block web scraping. All the same, web scrapers can still legally extract data by using sophisticated scraping APIs like ScraperAPI.

What are Scraper APIs?

Scraper APIs are tools that enable users to easily extract data from websites by providing the necessary infrastructure to bypass their anti-scraping mechanisms.

Can ChatGPT scrape websites?

No, ChatGPT cannot scrape websites. It was designed as an LLM and not a web scraping API. Nonetheless, it can be helpful for analyzing datasets built using web scraping.

#### Scale plan

Monthly

Annual

When choosing **Scale plan** you pay for parallel running jobs. You can increase or decrease the number of parallel running scraping job count as to suit your needs. The plan has an unlimited number of URL credits.

The amount of URLs that can be scraped per month depends on parallel running job count, configured request interval, target site response speed and driver that is used to access the page. Full JS driver executes all JavaScript in a page while Fast driver skips JavaScript execution.

#### Add-on Proxy

To make the Scale plan cost-effective, only a free US datacenter proxy is included. As an optional add-on, residential proxy is available for **$2.5/GB**. This ensures you only pay for the bandwidth you actually use.

When estimating proxy expenses, consider the average page size. On average, a page scraped with no rendering is 50–150 KB, while a page scraped with full rendering is 100–300 KB.

### Diego Kremer

Simply AMAZING. Was thinking about coding myself a simple scraper for a project and then found this super easy to use and very powerful scraper. Worked perfectly with all the websites I tried on. Saves a lot of time. Thanks for that!

### Carlos Figueroa

Powerful tool that beats the others out there. Has a learning curve to it but once you conquer that the sky's the limit. Definitely a tool worth making a donation on and supporting for continued development. Way to go for the authoring crew behind this tool.

### Jonathan H

This is fantastic! I'm saving hours, possibly days. I was trying to scrap and old site, badly made, no proper divs or markup. Using the WebScraper magic, it somehow "knew" the pattern after I selected 2 elements. Amazing. Yes, it's a learning curve and you HAVE to watch the video and read the docs. Don't rate it down just because you can't be bothered to learn it. If you put the effort in, this will save your butt one day!

Frequently asked questions

--------------------------

### What is a URL Credit?

A URL credit represents a single page loaded by the Web Scraper Cloud. For example if the scraper has to go through 100 pages, then 100 URL credits will be charged. If you are extracting 100 records from a single page, only one URL credit will be charged.

### Will I be able to scrape a specific site?

From our own experience we can say that none of the universal web scraping tools can scrape every site. You have to try it out for yourself. Try Web Scraper Cloud for free with no investments.

### Do I need to input my credit card information to start free trial?

No.

### How Scale plan differs from other plans?

Scale plan is built for large volume scraping. It offers unlimited URL credits with limited running scraping jobs that you can scale up or down as needed.

### Can I upgrade or downgrade my subscription plan?

Yes, you can upgrade your plan at any time during your subscription period. If you wish to downgrade your plan, you can schedule the changes, and the downgrade will take effect at the start of the next billing cycle.

My ultimate guide to web scraping

=================================

I've been doing some freelance web scraping for a few years now and thought it might be interesting to create a multi-part tutorial on building a scraping project with a data science end goal.

I've had an interest in political rhetoric in the news lately, so I thought it would be a worthwhile project to show how to go from basic news scraping to massive data analysis and NLP.

Part 1 is here if you're interested: [https://www.learndatasci.com/tutorials/ultimate-guide-web-scraping-w-python-requests-and-beautifulsoup/](https://www.learndatasci.com/tutorials/ultimate-guide-web-scraping-w-python-requests-and-beautifulsoup/)

I'd love to get feedback and answer any questions. There's a lot of tips and tricks I've picked up along the way that aren't explained very well, if at all, in most articles.

## Result 11: What is Web Scraping and What is it Used For? | ParseHub
**URL:** https://www.parsehub.com/blog/what-is-web-scraping
**Status Code:** 200
**Depth:** N/A

Web scraping is one of the most efficient and useful ways to extract data from a website, especially in 2023!

Some websites can contain a very large amount of invaluable data.

Stock prices, product details, sports stats, company contacts, you name it.

If you wanted to access this information, you’d either have to use whatever format the website uses or copy-paste the information manually into a new document. Here’s where web scraping can help.

What is Web Scraping?

---------------------

[Web scraping](https://parsehub.com/?ref=parsehub.com) refers to the **extraction of data from a website**. This information is collected and then exported into a format that is more useful for the user. Be it a spreadsheet or an API.

Although [web scraping can be done manually](https://www.upwork.com/search/profiles/?nbs=1&q=web+scraping&ref=parsehub.com), in most cases, automated tools are preferred when scraping web data as they can be less costly and work at a faster rate.

But in most cases, web scraping is not a simple task. [Websites come in many shapes and forms](https://www.expertmarket.co.uk/web-design/different-types-of-websites?ref=parsehub.com), as a result, web scrapers vary in functionality and features.

Please note that you may encounter captchas when attempting to scrape some websites, so we suggest reading several guides on how to avoid & bypass captchas before scraping a website:

*   [How to avoid and bypass captchas](https://proxyway.com/guides/how-to-bypass-captcha?ref=parsehub.com)

*   [Solving Captcha (for all Paid plans)](https://help.parsehub.com/hc/en-us/articles/115004504048-Solving-Captcha-for-all-Paid-plans-?ref=parsehub.com)

If you want to find the best web scraper for your project, make sure to read on.

Is web scraping legal?

----------------------

In short, the action of web scraping isn't illegal. However, some rules need to be followed. Web scraping becomes illegal when non publicly available data becomes extracted.

This comes as no surprise given the growth of web scraping and many recent legal cases related to web scraping.

If you want to learn more about the legality of web scraping, you can continue reading here: **[Is web scraping legal?](https://www.parsehub.com/blog/web-scraping-legal/)**

How do Web Scrapers Work?

-------------------------

So, [how do web scrapers work?](https://www.parsehub.com/blog/how-web-scraping-works/) [Automated web scrapers](https://parsehub.com/?ref=parsehub.com) work in a rather simple but also complex way. After all, websites are built for humans to understand, not machines.

First, the [web scraper](https://www.parsehub.com/?ref=parsehub.com) will be given one or more URLs to load before scraping. The scraper then loads the entire HTML code for the page in question. More advanced scrapers will render the entire website, including CSS and Javascript elements.

Then the scraper will either extract all the data on the page or specific data selected by the user before the project is run.

Ideally, the user will go through the process of selecting the specific data they want from the page. For example, you might want to scrape an Amazon product page for prices and models but are not necessarily interested in product reviews.

Lastly, the web scraper will output all the data that has been collected into a format that is more useful to the user.

Most web scrapers will output data to a CSV or [Excel spreadsheet](https://www.parsehub.com/blog/web-scraping-excel-sheet/), while more advanced scrapers will support other formats such as JSON which can be used for an API.

What Kind of Web Scrapers are There?

------------------------------------

Web scrapers can drastically differ from each other on a case-by-case basis.

For simplicity’s sake, we will break down some of these aspects into **4 categories**. Of course, there are more intricacies at play when comparing web scrapers.

*   self-built or pre-built

*   browser extension vs software

*   User interface

*   Cloud vs Local

### Self-built or Pre-built

Just like how anyone can build a website, anyone can [build their own web scraper](https://www.datacamp.com/community/tutorials/making-web-crawlers-scrapy-python?ref=parsehub.com).

However, the tools available to build your own web scraper still require some advanced programming knowledge. The scope of this knowledge also increases with the number of features you’d like your scraper to have.

On the other hand, there are numerous pre-built web scrapers that you can download and run right away. Some of these will also have advanced options added such as scrape scheduling, [JSON](www.parsehub.com/blog/scrape-data-json/) and [Google Sheets](www.parsehub.com/blog/scrape-web-content-into-google-sheets/) exports and more.

### Browser extension vs Software

In general terms, web scrapers come in two forms: browser extensions or computer software.

[Browser extensions](https://chrome.google.com/webstore/category/extensions?ref=parsehub.com) are app-like programs that can be added to your browsers such as Google Chrome or Firefox. Some popular browser extensions include themes, ad blockers, messaging extensions and more.

Web scraping extensions have the benefit of being simpler to run and being integrated right into your browser.

However, these extensions are usually limited by living in your browser. Meaning that any advanced features that would have to occur outside of the browser would be impossible to implement. For example, IP Rotations would not be possible in this kind of extension.

On the other hand, you will have actual web scraping software that can be downloaded and installed on your computer. While these are a bit less convenient than browser extensions, they make up for it in advanced features that are not limited by what your browser can and cannot do.

### User Interface

The user interface between web scrapers can vary quite extremely.

For example, some [web scraping tools](https://www.parsehub.com/blog/best-tools-web-scraping/) will run with a minimal UI and a command line. Some users might find this unintuitive or confusing.

On the other hand, some web scrapers will have a full-fledged UI where the website is fully rendered for the user to just click on the data they want to scrape. These web scrapers are usually easier to work with for most people with limited technical knowledge.

Some scrapers will go as far as integrating help tips and suggestions through their UI to make sure the user understands each feature that the software offers.

### Cloud vs Local

From where does your web scraper actually do its job?

Local web scrapers will run on your computer using its resources and internet connection. This means that if your web scraper has a high usage of CPU or RAM, your computer might become quite slow while your scrape runs. With long scraping tasks, this could put your computer out of commission for hours.

Additionally, if your scraper is set to run on a large number of URLs (such as product pages), it can have an impact on your ISP’s data caps.

Cloud-based web scrapers run on an off-site server which is usually provided by the company that developed the scraper itself. This means that your computer’s resources are freed up while your scraper runs and gathers data. You can then work on other tasks and be notified later once your scrape is ready to be exported.

This also allows for very easy integration of advanced features such as IP rotation, which can prevent your scraper from getting blocked from major websites due to their scraping activity.

What are Web Scrapers Used For?

-------------------------------

By this point, you can probably think of several different ways in which [web scrapers can be used](https://www.parsehub.com/blog/a-complete-guide-on-offering-web-scraping-services/). We’ve put some of the most common ones below (plus a few unique ones).

### **Real Estate Listing Scraping**

Many real estate agents use web scraping to populate their database of available properties for sale or for rent.

For example, a real estate agency will scrape MLS listings to build an API that directly populates this information onto their website. This way, they get to act as the agent for the property when someone finds this listing on their site.

Most listings that you will find on a Real Estate website are automatically generated by an API.

### **Industry Statistics and Insights**

Many companies use web scraping to build massive databases and draw industry-specific insights from these. These companies can then sell access to these insights to companies in said industries.

For example, a company might scrape and analyze tons of data about oil prices, exports and imports in order to sell their insights to oil companies across the world.

### **Comparison Shopping Sites**

Some several websites and applications can help you to easily compare pricing between several retailers for the same product.

One way that these websites work is by using web scrapers to scrape product data and pricing from each retailer daily. This way, they can provide their users with the comparison data they need.

### **Lead Generation**

One incredibly popular use of web scraping is lead generation. This use is so popular in fact, that we have written an entire guide on using web scraping for lead generation.

In short, web scraping is used by many companies to collect contact information about potential customers or clients. This is incredibly common in the business-to-business space, where potential customers will post their business information publicly online.

**Check out our guides of how you can use web scraping for your business:**
